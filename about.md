Hi,

I'm Quynh, a Fullstack Web Dev with a knack for human and programming languages. I learned (to love) coding at the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) in New York (a WeWork company). Currently I live in Germany, in a quiet small town called Paderborn. And now I am moving to Berlin to work at a small startup that makes software for cash registers.

It was during my time at the coding bootcamp that I started this blog. And I love it! It feels really good to put something out there that might make someone's life easier. How many debugging hours have I saved myself by stumbling over really useful blogs of people who were facing the exact same issues.

If you'd like to collaborate on a project, offer me money for coding or blogging, or just say hi, drop me a line on [LinkedIn]!

My skillset includes:
Ruby | Rails | SQL | ActiveRecord | Sinatra | Rack | Javascript | jQuery | React | Redux | Webpack | CSS | Bootstrap | Semantic | Sass | Jest 

My latest project is a React app called [Habit Tracker] with a Rails backend.

Check it out!
